This dofile is supplementary material to Menashe-Oren et al. "The dynamic role of household structure on child mortality in southern and eastern sub-Saharan Africa".

The programme uses data from Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSS) which follow individuals from a baseline survey, recording all the demographic events (births, deaths, migrations) in a geographically limited population.
Based on these event records, and an ID that connects individuals to a household, it is possible to create time-varying measures of household structure.
This programme was written using readily available HDSS data through the INDEPTH network, notably a dataset of combined HDSS in sub-Saharan Africa (https://www.indepth-ishare.org/index.php/catalog/181).
